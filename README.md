# Neural Network Approach for solving the Maier-Stein Committor problem

This project was done as part of UMD's 2022 math REU on machine learning methods in the study of rare events. 

#### Purpose: 
The Maier-Stein stochastic system is a benchmark 2D system for studying the committor problem. See my write up on my Linkedin for background on the committor problem. The goal of this code is to compare a neural network approach for obtaining a solution, tested against the ground truth finite elements method solution. 

#### Quick start instructions (how to install/run)

Installation (cloning the repo locally and setting up the virtual environment):
```bash
1. git clone https://github.com/williamclarktennis/MaierSteinCode.git
2. cd MaierSteinCode
3. python -m venv venv
4. source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
4b. venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
5. pip install -r requirements.txt
```
