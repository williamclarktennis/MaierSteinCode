# Neural Network Approach for solving the Maier-Stein Committor problem

This project was done as part of UMD's 2022 math REU on machine learning methods in the study of rare events. 

#### Purpose: 
The Maier-Stein stochastic system is a benchmark 2D system for studying the committor problem. See my write up on my Linkedin for background on the committor problem. The goal of this code is to compare a neural network approach for obtaining a solution, tested against the ground truth finite elements method solution.
